# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a Ph.D. student working under the supervision of Dr. [Sayan Ranu](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](https://cse.iitd.ac.in).


Research Interests:

   **1. Learning Combinatorial algorithms on graphs**
   
   **2. Learning to Solve Mixed Integer Programs**

   **3. Scalable learning on graphs**

   **4. Few shot learning/ Meta-Learning**

Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Research Engineer in the Machine learning and statistics group at Conduent Labs( Formerly Xerox Research Center India). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://iitg.ernet.in/cse).
